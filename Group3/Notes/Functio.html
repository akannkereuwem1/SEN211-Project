      A function is a relation between a set of inputs, called the domain, and a set of possible outputs,
      called the range. <br>It is a way of describing a relationship between variables.
     </span>
      <span>Types of Functions:</span>
      <span>- One-to-One Function: A function where each input corresponds to exactly one output.</span>
      <span>- Many-to-One Function: A function where multiple inputs can correspond to the same output.</span>
      <span>- Onto Function: A function where every output in the range corresponds to at least one input in</span>
      <span>the domain.</span>
      <span>Domain and Range:</span>
      <span>- Domain: The set of all possible input values.</span>
      <span>- Range: The set of all possible output values.</span>
      <span>Function Notation:</span>
      <span>- f(x) is read as "f of x" and represents the output value of the function for the input x.</span>
      <span>Composition of Functions:</span>
      <span>- The composition of two functions f and g is denoted by (f ∘ g)(x) = f(g(x)).</span>
      <span>- The composition of functions is associative, but not commutative.</span>
      <span>Inverse Functions:</span>
      <span>- The inverse of a function f is denoted by f^(-1).</span>
      <span>- The inverse function undoes the action of the original function.</span>
      <span>Graphs of Functions:</span>
      <span>- The graph of a function is a visual representation of the relationship between the input and</span>
      <span>output values.</span>
      <span>- The graph can be used to determine the domain and range of the function.</span>
      <span class="examples">Examples of Functions:</span>
      <span>- Linear functions: f(x) = mx + b</span>
      <span>- Quadratic functions: f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c</span>
      <span>- Exponential functions: f(x) = a^x</span>
      <span>Tips for Working with Functions:</span>
      <span>- Use function notation to represent the relationship between variables.</span>
      <span>- Determine the domain and range of the function.</span>
      <span>- Use graphs to visualize the relationship between the input and output values.</span>
      <span>- Use composition and inverse functions to solve problems.</span>
