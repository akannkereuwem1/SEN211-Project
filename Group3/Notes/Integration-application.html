      <h1>APPLICATION OF INTEGRATION</h1>
    </header>
    <article class="body-text">
      <span>Integration has numerous applications in various fields, including physics, engineering,</span>
      <span>economics, and computer science.</span>
      <span>Area and Volume:</span>
      <span>- Finding the area under curves and surfaces</span>
      <span>- Finding the volume of solids and liquids</span>
      <span>- Examples: area of a circle, volume of a sphere</span>
      <span>Physical Applications:</span>
      <span>- Work and Energy: finding the work done by a force</span>
      <span>- Center of Mass: finding the center of mass of an object</span>
      <span>- Momentum: finding the momentum of an object</span>
      <span>Economics:</span>
      <span>- Consumer Surplus: finding the consumer surplus of a market</span>
      <span>- Producer Surplus: finding the producer surplus of a market</span>
      <span>- Cost-Benefit Analysis: finding the optimal solution to a problem</span>
      <span>Engineering:</span>
      <span>- Design of Structures: finding the stress and strain on a structure</span>
      <span>- Electrical Engineering: finding the current and voltage in a circuit</span>
      <span>- Mechanical Engineering: finding the force and torque on a machine</span>
      <span>Computer Science:</span>
      <span>- Algorithm Design: finding the optimal solution to a problem</span>
      <span>- Machine Learning: finding the optimal parameters for a model</span>
      <span>- Data Analysis: finding the trends and patterns in a dataset</span>
      <span>Techniques of Application:</span>
      <span>- Integration by Parts: used to integrate products of functions</span>
      <span>- Integration by Partial Fractions: used to integrate rational functions</span>
      <span>- Improper Integrals: used to integrate functions with infinite limits</span>
      <span class="examples">Examples:</span>
      <span>- Find the area under the curve of y = x^2 from x = 0 to x = 2.</span>
      <span>- Find the volume of the solid formed by revolving the region under the curve of y = x^2 about</span>
      <span>the x-axis.</span>
      <span>- Find the work done by a force F(x) = 2x + 1 in moving an object from x = 0 to x = 3.</span>
      <span>Tips for Working with Applications of Integration:</span>
      <span>- Identify the problem and the objective function.</span>
      <span>- Use integration to find the solution to the problem.</span>
      <span>- Apply techniques of integration, such as integration by parts and integration by partial</span>
      <span>fractions.</span>
      <span>- Interpret the results in the context of the problem.</span>
