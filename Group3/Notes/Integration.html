      <span>_Integration of a Function_</span>
      <span>Integration is the process of finding the antiderivative of a function, which represents the area</span>
      <span>under the curve of the function.</span>
      <span>Types of Integration:</span>
      <span>- Indefinite Integration: finding the antiderivative of a function</span>
      <span>- Definite Integration: finding the area under the curve of a function between two points</span>
      <span>Basic Rules of Integration:</span>
      <span>- Constant Multiple Rule: ∫af(x)dx = a∫f(x)dx</span>
      <span>- Sum Rule: ∫f(x) + g(x)dx = ∫f(x)dx + ∫g(x)dx</span>
      <span>- Power Rule: ∫x^n dx = (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C</span>
      <span>- Exponential Rule: ∫e^x dx = e^x + C</span>
      <span>Integration of Trigonometric Functions:</span>
      <span>- ∫sin(x) dx = -cos(x) + C</span>
      <span>- ∫cos(x) dx = sin(x) + C</span>
      <span>- ∫tan(x) dx = -ln|cos(x)| + C</span>
      <span>Integration by Substitution:</span>
      <span>- Used to integrate functions that can be expressed as a composite function</span>
      <span>- Formula: ∫f(g(x))g'(x)dx = ∫f(u)du</span>
      <span>Integration by Parts:</span>
      <span>- Used to integrate functions that are products of two functions</span>
      <span>- Formula: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du</span>
      <span>Definite Integration:</span>
      <span>- Used to find the area under the curve of a function between two points</span>
      <span>- Formula: ∫[a, b] f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)</span>
      <span class="examples">Examples:</span>
      <span>- Find the indefinite integral of f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 5.</span>
      <span>- Find the definite integral of f(x) = x^2 from x = 0 to x = 2.</span>
      <span>Tips for Working with Integration:</span>
      <span>- Use the basic rules of integration to simplify complex integrals.</span>
      <span>- Apply integration by substitution and integration by parts to solve integrals.</span>
      <span>- Use definite integration to find the area under the curve of a function.</span>
