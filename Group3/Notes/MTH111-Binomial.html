      <h1>BINOMIAL THEOREM</h1>
    </header>
    <article class="body-text">
     <span>The Binomial Theorem is a fundamental concept in algebra that describes the expansion of
      powers of a binomial. <br>It is a powerful tool for simplifying expressions and solving equations.
      Statement of the Binomial Theorem:</span>
<span>- (a + b)^n = ∑[n!/(k!(n-k)!)]a^(n-k)b^k, where n is a positive integer and k ranges from 0 to n</span>
<span>Understanding the Binomial Theorem:</span>
<span>- _Binomial Coefficients_: the coefficients of the terms in the expansion, denoted as n!/(k!(n-k)!)</span>
<span>- _Pascal's Triangle_: a triangular array of binomial coefficients, used to calculate the</span>
<span>coefficients</span>
<span>- _Expansion_: the process of writing out the terms of the binomial expansion</span>
<span>Applications of the Binomial Theorem:</span>
<span>- _Algebraic Expressions_: simplifying expressions involving powers of binomials</span>
<span>- _Equations_: solving equations involving binomial expressions</span>
<span>- _Probability_: calculating probabilities involving binomial distributions</span>
<span class="examples">Examples:</span>
<span>- Expand the expression: (x + y)^3</span>
<span>- Simplify the expression: (2x + 3y)^2</span>
<span>- Use the Binomial Theorem to solve the equation: (x + 2)^4 = 16</span>
<span>Tips for Working with the Binomial Theorem:</span>
<span>- Understand the statement of the Binomial Theorem and how to apply it.</span>
<span>- Practice expanding and simplifying binomial expressions.</span>
<span>- Use Pascal's Triangle to calculate binomial coefficients.</span>
<span>Common Mistakes to Avoid:</span>
<span>- Forgetting to include all terms in the expansion.</span>
<span>- Incorrectly calculating binomial coefficients.</span>
<span>- Failing to simplify the expression fully.</span>
