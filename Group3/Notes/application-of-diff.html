      <h1>APPLICATION OF DIFFERENTIATION</h1>
    </header>
    <article class="body-text">
      <span>Differentiation has numerous applications in various fields, including physics, engineering,</span>
      <span>economics, and computer science.</span>
      <span>Optimization Problems:</span>
      <span>- Finding the maximum and minimum values of a function</span>
      <span>- Determining the optimal size, shape, or quantity of a system</span>
      <span>- Examples: maximizing profit, minimizing cost, maximizing area</span>
      <span>Motion Along a Line:</span>
      <span>- Finding the velocity and acceleration of an object</span>
      <span>- Determining the position of an object at a given time</span>
      <span>- Examples: projectile motion, circular motion</span>
      <span>Motion Along a Curve:</span>
      <span>- Finding the tangent and normal vectors to a curve</span>
      <span>- Determining the curvature and radius of curvature of a curve</span>
      <span>- Examples: curve fitting, trajectory planning</span>
      <span>Economics:</span>
      <span>- Finding the marginal cost and revenue of a product</span>
      <span>- Determining the optimal price and quantity of a product</span>
      <span>- Examples: supply and demand analysis, cost-benefit analysis</span>
      <span>Physics and Engineering:</span>
      <span>- Finding the force and torque acting on an object</span>
      <span>- Determining the energy and momentum of an object</span>
      <span>- Examples: mechanics, electromagnetism, thermodynamics</span>
      <span>Computer Science:</span>
      <span>- Finding the maximum and minimum values of a function</span>
      <span>- Determining the optimal solution to a problem</span>
      <span>- Examples: algorithm design, machine learning</span>
      <span>Techniques of Optimization:</span>
      <span>- First Derivative Test: finding the critical points of a function</span>
      <span>- Second Derivative Test: determining the nature of the critical points</span>
      <span>- Graphical Method: visualizing the function to determine the optimal solution</span>
      <span class="examples">Examples:</span>
      <span>- Find the maximum area of a rectangle with a fixed perimeter.</span>
      <span>- Find the minimum cost of producing a product.</span>
      <span>- Find the maximum velocity of an object moving along a curve.</span>
      <span>Tips for Working with Applications of Differentiation:</span>
      <span>- Identify the problem and the objective function.</span>
      <span>- Use differentiation to find the critical points.</span>
      <span>- Apply the first and second derivative tests to determine the nature of the critical points.</span>
      <span>- Use graphical methods to visualize the function and determine the optimal solution.</span>
