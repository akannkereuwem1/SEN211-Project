      <span>Derivative:
        <br>- The derivative of a function f(x) is denoted by f'(x) or (df/dx).</span>
      <span>- It represents the rate of change of the function with respect to x.</span>
      <span>- Geometrically, it is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of f(x) at a point.</span>
      <span>Definition of Derivative:</span>
      <span>- f'(x) = lim(h → 0) [f(x + h) - f(x)]/h</span>
      <span>Rules of Differentiation:</span>
      <span>- Power Rule: If f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = nx^(n-1)</span>
      <span>- Product Rule: If f(x) = u(x)v(x), then f'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)</span>
      <span>- Quotient Rule: If f(x) = u(x)/v(x), then f'(x) = (u'(x)v(x) - u(x)v'(x)) / v(x)^2</span>
      <span>- Chain Rule: If f(x) = g(h(x)), then f'(x) = g'(h(x))h'(x)</span>span>Derivatives of Trigonometric Functions:</span>
      <span>- d(sin x)/dx = cos x</span>
      <span>- d(cos x)/dx = -sin x</span>
      <span>- d(tan x)/dx = sec^2 x</span>
      <span>Derivatives of Exponential and Logarithmic Functions:</span>
      <span>- d(e^x)/dx = e^x</span>
      <span>- d(ln x)/dx = 1/x</span>
      <span>Applications of Derivatives:</span>
      <span>- Finding the maximum and minimum values of a function</span>
      <span>- Determining the rate of change of a function</span>
      <span>- Finding the equation of the tangent line to a curve</span>
      <span class="examples">Examples:</span>
      <span>- Find the derivative of f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 5.</span>
      <span>- Find the derivative of f(x) = sin(2x).</span>
      <span>Tips for Working with Derivatives:</span>
      <span>- Use the definition of derivative to find the derivative of a function.</span>
      <span>- Apply the rules of differentiation to simplify complex derivatives.</span>
      <span>- Use derivatives to solve optimization problems.</span>
