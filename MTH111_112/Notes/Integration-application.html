      <h1>APPLICATION OF INTEGRATION</h1>
    </header>
    <article class="body-text">
      <span>Integration has numerous applications in various fields, including physics, engineering,</span>
      <span>economics, and computer science.</span>
      <span class="examples">Area and Volume:</span>
      <span> Finding the area under curves and surfaces</span>
      <span> Finding the volume of solids and liquids</span>
      <span> Examples: area of a circle, volume of a sphere</span>
      <span class="examples">Physical Applications:</span>
      <span> Work and Energy: finding the work done by a force</span>
      <span> Center of Mass: finding the center of mass of an object</span>
      <span> Momentum: finding the momentum of an object</span>
      <span class="examples">Economics:</span>
      <span> Consumer Surplus: finding the consumer surplus of a market</span>
      <span> Producer Surplus: finding the producer surplus of a market</span>
      <span> Cost-Benefit Analysis: finding the optimal solution to a problem</span>
      <span class="examples">Engineering:</span>
      <span> Design of Structures: finding the stress and strain on a structure</span>
      <span> Electrical Engineering: finding the current and voltage in a circuit</span>
      <span> Mechanical Engineering: finding the force and torque on a machine</span>
      <span>Computer Science:</span>
      <span> Algorithm Design: finding the optimal solution to a problem</span>
      <span> Machine Learning: finding the optimal parameters for a model</span>
      <span> Data Analysis: finding the trends and patterns in a dataset</span>
      <span class="examples">Techniques of Application:</span>
      <span> Integration by Parts: used to integrate products of functions</span>
      <span> Integration by Partial Fractions: used to integrate rational functions</span>
      <span> Improper Integrals: used to integrate functions with infinite limits</span>
      <span class="examples">Examples:</span>
      <span> Find the area under the curve of y = x^2 from x = 0 to x = 2.</span>
      <span> Find the volume of the solid formed by revolving the region under the curve of y = x^2 about</span>
      <span>the x-axis.</span>
      <span> Find the work done by a force F(x) = 2x + 1 in moving an object from x = 0 to x = 3.</span>
      <span class="examples">Tips for Working with Applications of Integration:</span>
      <span> Identify the problem and the objective function.</span>
      <span> Use integration to find the solution to the problem.</span>
      <span> Apply techniques of integration, such as integration by parts and integration by partial</span>
      <span>fractions.</span>
      <span> Interpret the results in the context of the problem.</span>
