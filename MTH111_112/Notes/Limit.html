      <span>Limit:</span>
      <span> The limit of a function f(x) as x approaches a is denoted by lim x→a f(x) = L.</span>
      <span> It represents the value that the function approaches as the input gets arbitrarily close to a.</span>
      <span> Types of limits: one-sided limit, two-sided limit, infinite limit.</span>
      <span class="examples">Continuity:</span>
      <span> A function f(x) is continuous at a point a if lim x→a f(x) = f(a).</span>
      <span> A function is continuous on an interval if it is continuous at every point in the interval.</span>
      <span>- Types of discontinuity: removable discontinuity, jump discontinuity, infinite discontinuity.</span>
      <span class="examples">Properties of Limits:</span><span>- Linearity: lim x→a [f(x) + g(x)] = lim x→a f(x) + lim x→a g(x)</span>
      <span> Homogeneity: lim x→a [cf(x)] = c lim x→a f(x)</span>
      <span> Sum, difference, product, and quotient rules.</span>
      <span class="examples">Properties of Continuity:</span>
      <span> Sum, difference, product, and quotient of continuous functions are continuous.</span>
      <span> Composition of continuous functions is continuous.</span>
      <span> Continuous functions on a closed interval are bounded and attain their bounds.</span>
      <span class="examples">Types of Discontinuities:</span>
      <span> Removable discontinuity: lim x→a f(x) exists, but f(a) is not defined.</span>
      <span> Jump discontinuity: lim x→a- f(x) ≠ lim x→a+ f(x)</span>
      <span> Infinite discontinuity: lim x→a f(x) = ∞ or -∞</span>
      <span class="examples">Examples:</span>
      <span> Find the limit of f(x) = (x^2 - 4) / (x - 2) as x approaches 2.</span>
      <span> Determine if the function f(x) = |x| is continuous at x = 0.</span>
      <span class="examples">Tips for Working with Limits and Continuity:</span>
      <span> Use limit properties to simplify complex limits.</span>
      <span> Check for continuity at a point by using the definition of continuity.</span>
      <span> Identify types of discontinuities to determine if a function is continuous.</span></article>
