    <article class="body-text">
      <span> Logarithms and indices are fundamental concepts in mathematics, particularly in algebra and
        calculus.
        Indices:</span>
      <span class="examples">Definition: a number that is raised to a power to produce another number</span>
      <span>Example: 2^3 = 8, where 2 is the base and 3 is the index</span>
      <span class="examples">Laws of Indices:</span>
      <span> a^m × a^n = a^(m+n)</span>
      <span> a^m ÷ a^n = a^(m-n)</span>
      <span> (a^m)^n = a^(mn)</span>
      <span class="examples">Logarithms:</span>
      <span>Definition: the inverse operation of exponentiation</span>
      <span>Example: log2(8) = 3, where 2 is the base and 8 is the result</span>
      <span class="examples"> Types of Logarithms:</span>
      <span> Natural Logarithm (ln)</span>
      <span> Common Logarithm (log)</span>
      <span> Logarithm to the base 2 (log2)</span>
      <span class="examples">Properties of Logarithms:</span>
      <span>Product Rule_: log(ab) = log(a) + log(b)</span>
      <span>Quotient Rule_: log(a/b) = log(a) - log(b)</span>
      <span class="examples">Applications of Logarithms and Indices:</span>
      <span>Simplifying Complex Expressions: logarithms and indices can be used to simplify complex
        expressions</span>
      <span class="examples">Solving Equations: logarithms and indices can be used to solve equations involving
        exponents</span>
      <span class="examples">Modeling Real-World Phenomena_: logarithms and indices can be used to model population
        growth, chemical reactions, and other real-world phenomena</span>
      <span class="examples">Examples:</span>
      <span> Simplify the expression: 2^3 × 2^4</span>

      <span> Solve the equation: 2^x = 16</span>
      <span> Use logarithms to model the population growth of a city.</span>
      <span>Tips for Working with Logarithms and Indices:</span>
      <span> Understand the laws of indices and properties of logarithms.</span>
      <span> Practice simplifying complex expressions and solving equations involving exponents.</span>
      <span> Apply logarithms and indices to real-world problems to develop a deeper understanding of
        these concepts.</span>
