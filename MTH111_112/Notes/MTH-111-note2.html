      <span>Sets and Venn diagrams are fundamental concepts in mathematics, used to represent and
        analyze collections of objects.</span>
      <span>Sets:</span>
      <span>Definition: a well-defined collection of unique objects, known as elements or members</span>
      <span>Notation: sets are denoted using curly brackets, e.g., A = {1, 2, 3}</span>
      <span class="examples">Types of Sets:</span>
      <span> Empty Set: a set with no elements, denoted as ∅</span>
      <span> Singleton Set: a set with only one element</span>
      <span> Finite Set: a set with a finite number of elements</span>
      <span> Infinite Set: a set with an infinite number of elements
        Set Operations:</span>
      <span>Union: the combination of two or more sets, denoted as A ∪ B</span>
      <span>Intersection: the set of elements common to two or more sets, denoted as A ∩ B</span>
      <span>Difference: the set of elements in one set but not in another, denoted as A - B</span>
      <span>Complement: the set of elements not in a given set, denoted as A'</span>
      <span>Venn Diagrams:</span>
      <span>Definition: a visual representation of sets and their relationships</span>
      <span>Components: circles or ellipses representing sets, with overlapping regions indicating intersections</span>
      <span class="examples">Types of Venn Diagrams:</span>
      <span> Two-Set Venn Diagram: represents the relationship between two sets</span>
      <span> Three-Set Venn Diagram: represents the relationship between three sets
        Applications of Sets and Venn Diagrams:</span>
      
      <span>Data Analysis: sets and Venn diagrams can be used to analyze and visualize data</span>
      <span>Problem-Solving: sets and Venn diagrams can be used to solve problems involving
        combinations and intersections of sets</span>
      <span>Computer Science: sets and Venn diagrams are used in computer programming and
        database management</span>
      <span class="examples">Examples:</span>
      <span> Find the union and intersection of two sets: A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}</span>
      <span> Draw a Venn diagram to represent the relationship between three sets: A, B, and C</span>
      <span class="examples"> Use sets and Venn diagrams to solve a problem involving the combination of two or more sets.
        Tips for Working with Sets and Venn Diagrams:</span>
      <span> Understand the definitions and notation of sets and Venn diagrams.</span>
      <span> Practice working with set operations, such as union, intersection, and difference.</span>
      <span> Use Venn diagrams to visualize and analyze relationships between sets.</span>
