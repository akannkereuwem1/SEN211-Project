      <h1>PARTIAL FRACTION</h1>
    </header>
    <article class="body-text">
     <span> Partial fractions are a way of expressing a rational function as a sum of simpler fractions. This
      technique is useful for integrating rational functions,</span><span>solving differential equations, and finding
        inverse Laplace transforms.</span> 
<span class="examples">Types of Partial Fractions:</span>
<span>Simple Partial Fractions: of the form A/(x-a), where A is a constant and a is a real number</span>
<span>Repeated Partial Fractions: of the form A/(x-a)^n, where n is a positive integer</span>
<span>Partial Fractions with Quadratic Factors: of the form (Ax+B)/(x^2+px+q), where A, B, p, and
  q are constants</span>
<span class="examples">Method of Partial Fractions:</span>
<span>1. Factor the denominator of the rational function into linear and quadratic factors.</span>
<span>2. Write the partial fraction decomposition with unknown constants.</span>
<span>3. Multiply both sides of the equation by the denominator to eliminate fractions.</span>
<span>4. Expand the right-hand side and equate coefficients of like terms.</span>
<span>5. Solve the resulting system of equations for the unknown constants.</span>
<span class="examples">Examples:</span>

<span> Express the rational function 1/(x^2+2x+1) as partial fractions.</span>
<span> Integrate the rational function 2/(x^2-4) using partial fractions.</span>
<span>Tips for Working with Partial Fractions:</span>
<span> Factor the denominator carefully to ensure that all factors are accounted for.</span>
<span> Use the correct form of the partial fraction decomposition based on the type of factor</span>.
<span> Check your work by plugging the partial fraction decomposition back into the original equation.</span>
<span class="examples">Common Mistakes to Avoid:</span>
<span> Forgetting to factor the denominator completely.</span>
<span> Using the wrong form of the partial fraction decomposition.</span>
<span> Failing to check the work by plugging the partial fraction decomposition back into the original
  equation.</span>
