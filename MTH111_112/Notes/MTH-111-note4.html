    <article class="body-text">
     <span> Complex numbers are numbers that can be expressed in the form a + bi, where a and b are real
      numbers and i is the imaginary unit, satisfying i^2 = -1.</span>
     <span class="examples"> Definition and Notation:</span>
      <span>Complex Number: a number of the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers</span>
      <span>Real Part: the real number a in the complex number a + bi</span>
      <span>Imaginary Part: the real number b in the complex number a + bi</span>
      <span>Modulus: the distance of the complex number from the origin, denoted as |a + bi|</span>
<span>  Argument: the angle between the positive real axis and the line segment connecting the
  origin to the complex number</span>
      <span class="examples">Operations on Complex Numbers:</span>
      <span>Addition: (a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i</span>
      <span>Subtraction: (a + bi) - (c + di) = (a - c) + (b - d)i</span>
      <span>Multiplication: (a + bi)(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i</span>
      <span>Division: (a + bi)/(c + di) = ((ac + bd)/(c^2 + d^2)) + ((bc - ad)/(c^2 + d^2))i</span>
      <span>Conjugate: the complex number a - bi is the conjugate of a + bi</span>
      <span>Modulus and Argument: the modulus and argument of a complex number can be used to
        represent it in polar form</span>
      
      <span class="examples">Applications of Complex Numbers:</span>
      <span>Algebra and Geometry: complex numbers are used to solve algebraic equations and
        represent geometric transformations</span>
      <span>Calculus and Analysis: complex numbers are used to extend the concepts of calculus and
        analysis to complex-valued functions</span>
      <span>Physics and Engineering: complex numbers are used to represent and analyze AC circuits,
        signals, and systems</span>
      <span class="examples">Examples:</span>
      <span>Simplify the expression: (2 + 3i)(4 - 5i)</span>
      <span> Find the modulus and argument of the complex number: 3 + 4i</span>
      <span>Use complex numbers to solve the equation: x^2 + 4 = 0</span>
      <span class="examples">Tips for Working with Complex Numbers:</span>
      <span>Understand the definition and notation of complex numbers.</span>
      <span>Practice performing operations on complex numbers, such as addition, subtraction,
        multiplication, and division.</span>
      <span> Use the properties of complex numbers, such as conjugates and modulus, to simplify
        expressions and solve equations.</span>
