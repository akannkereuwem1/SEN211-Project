      <span> Logarithms and indices are fundamental concepts in mathematics, particularly in algebra and
        calculus.
        Indices:</span>
      <span>- _Definition_: a number that is raised to a power to produce another number</span>
      <span>- _Example_: 2^3 = 8, where 2 is the base and 3 is the index</span>
      <span>- _Laws of Indices_:</span>
      <span>- a^m × a^n = a^(m+n)</span>
      <span>- a^m ÷ a^n = a^(m-n)</span>
      <span>- (a^m)^n = a^(mn)</span>
      <span>Logarithms:</span>
      <span>- _Definition_: the inverse operation of exponentiation</span>
      <span>- _Example_: log2(8) = 3, where 2 is the base and 8 is the result</span>
      <span>- _Types of Logarithms_:</span>
      <span>- Natural Logarithm (ln)</span>
      <span>- Common Logarithm (log)</span>
      <span>- Logarithm to the base 2 (log2)</span>
      <span>Properties of Logarithms:</span>
      <span>- _Product Rule_: log(ab) = log(a) + log(b)</span>
      <span>- _Quotient Rule_: log(a/b) = log(a) - log(b)</span>
      <span>Applications of Logarithms and Indices:</span>
      <span>- _Simplifying Complex Expressions_: logarithms and indices can be used to simplify complex
        expressions</span>
      <span>- _Solving Equations_: logarithms and indices can be used to solve equations involving
        exponents</span>
      <span>- _Modeling Real-World Phenomena_: logarithms and indices can be used to model population
        growth, chemical reactions, and other real-world phenomena</span>
      <span class="examples">Examples:</span>
      <span>- Simplify the expression: 2^3 × 2^4</span>

      <span>- Solve the equation: 2^x = 16</span>
      <span>- Use logarithms to model the population growth of a city.</span>
      <span>Tips for Working with Logarithms and Indices:</span>
      <span>- Understand the laws of indices and properties of logarithms.</span>
      <span>- Practice simplifying complex expressions and solving equations involving exponents.</span>
      <span>- Apply logarithms and indices to real-world problems to develop a deeper understanding of
        these concepts.</span>
